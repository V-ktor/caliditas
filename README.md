# Caliditias
In this card game the key attribute is the temperature of the cards. Every creature has a temperature and can only attack and destroy weaker creatures of the opposite element. Therefore the temperature attribute serves as combined attack and defense value.
Caliditias was originally made for the Godot Community Game Jam - June 2018.

This is a project meant to be used with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) version 3.4.4. Check the releases page for precompiled releases.
